          Ever since I was a child, I had always found that I don't seem to fit in, so instead of trying to fit in, I tried to find myself and who I am. I had always loved math and science, so I knew I wanted to do something with either math or science or both.

          When I first played minecraft, I had always had a thing for building and making things. I would design elaborate buildings. It wasn't until my sister had told me that I should become an architect that really opened my eyes to what I wanted to do.
        </p>
        <p className="discript">
          After a year of going to college for Architecture, and having a heartbreaking event, I had a life crises. Living day by day with out any passion or dream. I decided to find a job and work on myself. During that time I was working at Chipotle.

        <p className="discript">
          After a year of working at Chipotle, I had learned every position there and had driven myself bored or had burned myself out. I was at a standstill and had no idea what I really wanted to do. After awhile, my brother-in-law had asked me what I wanted to do, and he sugested coding.
        </p>
        <p className="discript">
          I had done a little of coding in the past, but never persued it as a career. When my brother-in-law suggested persueing it, it opened my eyes and I found another step that I could take to the top.
